<h1>Abstract.</h1>

> [!WARNING]
> AnalyticalEngine is currently in **beta.**
> This means that certain features such as custom mapmodes and Event Effects are supported, but only partially implemented - with MP support still in testing.

AnalyticalEngine (Project Orion) is a development effort to open-source the core binary code of AOC3 and improve moddability by allowing for custom <a href = "https://github.com/openjdk/nashorn">NashornJS</a> scripts in mods, providing an API for Event Conditions, Effects, and Game Scopes, modded Multiplayer (MP) support, as well as custom mapmodes and custom UIs. Completed builds are available as the current src/AOC3-Source.jar. This may be downloaded dropped into any basegame AOC3 directory to gain access to the current stable version of AnalyticalEngine.
