Answer to Dept's 284, Feb 3 [13] involves questions so intricate, so delicate, so strange to our form of thought, and so important to analysis of our international environment that I cannot compress answers into single brief message without yielding to what I feel would be dangerous degree of over-simplification. I hope, therefore, Dept will bear with me if I submit in answer to this question five parts, subjects of which will be roughly as follows: \n(1) Basic features of post-war Soviet outlook.\n(2) Background of this outlook\n(3) Its projection in practical policy on official level.\n(4) Its projection on unofficial level.\n(5) Practical deductions from standpoint of US policy.\nI apologize in advance for this burdening of telegraphic channel; but questions involved are of such urgent importance, particularly in view of recent events, that our answers to them, if they deserve attention at all, seem to me to deserve it at once.",
